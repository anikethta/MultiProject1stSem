# A "Rudimentary" 2D Physics Engine - MVC Semester 1 Project
written by Aniketh Tarikonda

**NOTE: I threw this together in like 2 days! It is rather buggy, and still has several problems. Please holistically review my code**

## TO-DO
    1. Fix Object Clipping Issues
    2. Clean up messy code -- In Progress
    3. Make a parent Object class, and have Circle & Magnet inherit from it. Currently, theres a lot of redunancy between both.  
    4. More forces????
im probably not gonna update this after my presentation, so... expect this to-do to last quite a while
